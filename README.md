## 🧩 HTML Interview Questions

### 1️⃣ How does the HTML5 concept of 'content categories' refine the traditional 'block vs. inline' model for developers?

- A) It merges all elements into a single 'flow' category, removing all nesting restrictions to provide developers with greater layout flexibility.
- B) It is an older, outdated system from XHTML that describes visual rendering, which has been replaced by the more modern 'block vs. inline' model.
- C) It formally deprecates the 'block vs. inline' model, replacing it with a new layout system that relies exclusively on CSS for all structural placement.
- D) It shifts focus from visual rendering to structural rules, defining where elements can be placed semantically.

### 2️⃣ What key behavioral difference regarding vertical `padding` distinguishes a standard inline element from a block-level element?

- A) On an inline element, vertical padding only works if the `box-sizing` CSS property is set to `border-box`, otherwise it is completely ignored.
- B) On an inline element, vertical padding is visually applied but does not affect the line height or push away content on lines above or below it.
- C) Vertical padding on an inline element is completely ignored, just like vertical margin, having no visual effect on the element's background.
- D) Vertical padding is fully respected on both element types, increasing the element's height and pushing away all surrounding content equally.

### 3️⃣ What is the primary advantage of using relative paths over absolute paths for linking to resources within the same website project?

- A) It is a mandatory requirement of the HTML5 specification. 
- B) Improves security by obscuring the full server URL path.
- C) Reduces page load times due to shorter text strings.
- D) Ensures project portability across different servers or folders.

### 4️⃣ What is the correct modern replacement for the deprecated `<font>` tag?

- A) It is not deprecated; it is still the primary way to set text styles in HTML.
- B) The `<strong>` tag for font weight and `<em>` for font style.
- C) Using CSS properties like `font-family`, `font-size`, and `color`.
- D) The `<text>` tag, which consolidates all font attributes.

---

### 5️⃣ What is the primary difference between the DOM and the HTML source code?

- A) The DOM is stored on the server, while the source code is on the client.
- B) The DOM only includes visible elements, while the source code includes all tags.
- C) The DOM is written in JavaScript, while the source code is in HTML.
- D) The DOM is a live, in-memory model, while the source code is a static text file.
